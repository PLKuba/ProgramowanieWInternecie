I also like his work attitude; he has been very persistent in his performance and efforts. He has already collected a considerable amount of experience and knows how to independently approach new problems in order to find a solution. Jakub Niewczas is also actively helping newer developers in my team with his knowledge. I enjoy working with him and his help is a notable alleviation for me in these stressful times. I can warmly recommend to accept him for a machine learning focused internship.",
